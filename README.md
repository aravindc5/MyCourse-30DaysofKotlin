**Concepts used:**

**1)Data Classes:**

Kotlin has a better solution for classes that are used to hold data/state. Itâ€™s called a Data Class. A Data Class is like a regular class but with some additional functionalities. So in this project data classes are used for storing description,and contents of each language.

**2)Inheritance:**

RecyclerView is used to display the contents of each language, Adapter is implemented using Inheritance concept which reduces the boiler plate code.

**3)Lambdas:**
Lambdas Expressions are essentially anonymous functions that we can treat as values.To set ranking of each programming language lamda expression is used.
