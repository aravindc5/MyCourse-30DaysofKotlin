**Concepts used:**

**1)Data Classes:**

Data Classes are used to store data in a structured manner, so in this project i have used data classes for storing description,and contents of each language.

**2)Inheritance:**

RecyclerView is used to display the contents of each language, Adapter is implemented using Inheritance concept which reduces the boiler plate code.

**3)Lambdas:**

To set ranking of each programming language lamda expression is used.
