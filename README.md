# MyCourse-30DaysofKotlin
This project is about 30 Days Coding Program By Google on Kotlin.

My Course is a android application that consist of several programming languages and for each programming language online tutorial websites and resources are added for easy access.

Concepts used:

1)Data Classes:

Data Classes are used to store data in a structured manner, so in this project i have used data classes for storing description,and contents of each language.

2)Inheritance:

RecyclerView is used to display the contents of each language, Adapter is implemented using Inheritance concept which reduces the boiler plate code.

3)Lambdas:

To set ranking of each programming language lamda expression is used.
